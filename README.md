**Arithmetic Rush**
Arithmetic Rush is an advanced dynamic math quiz application designed to challenge and develop mental arithmetic skills under timed conditions. The game dynamically generates randomized arithmetic problems with real-time accuracy tracking, performance metrics, and adaptive difficulty levels to create an immersive learning experience.

**Project Highlights**

Dynamic Problem Generation: Problems are randomized in real-time, covering fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) to ensure a unique set of challenges in each session.
Adaptive Feedback: Real-time error tracking allows users to receive instant feedback and retry until correct, promoting learning through self-correction.
Performance Metrics: The game tracks total completion time, counts incorrect attempts, and calculates an accuracy percentage upon finishing, providing detailed insights into the user’s performance.

**Key Features**
Real-Time Accuracy Scoring: The game calculates an accuracy percentage based on correct responses relative to total problems, providing an insightful metric at the end.
Timing and Efficiency: Execution time is precisely measured and rounded for clean, accurate timing metrics, encouraging users to improve both speed and accuracy over repeated plays.
Error Handling and Robustness: Built-in error handling and responsive problem generation maintain a smooth, uninterrupted user experience.

**Customization and Extension**
Arithmetic Rush is structured for easy customization. Modify in-code parameters to adapt the game’s difficulty, including:
Operators: Adjust the list of supported operators.
Operand Range: Set minimum and maximum values for operand ranges to scale difficulty.
Total Problems: Define the number of problems for each session.
